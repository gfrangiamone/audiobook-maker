# 📚 Audiobook Maker

**Convert your EPUB and TXT ebooks into high-quality audiobooks using neural text-to-speech voices.**

Audiobook Maker is a self-hosted web application that turns any EPUB or TXT file into a full audiobook in minutes. It leverages Microsoft Edge's neural TTS engine (via [edge-tts](https://github.com/rany2/edge-tts)) to produce natural-sounding audio in multiple languages, with no API keys, no subscriptions, and no data retention.

- **EPUB & TXT support** — automatic chapter extraction, smart front-matter filtering, cover image display
- **Audio preview** — listen to a sample of your book with the selected voice and speed before generating the full audiobook
- **Flexible output** — single MP3 file or one file per chapter (ZIP archive)

- **Chapter selection** — choose which chapters to include, reorder, select all / deselect all

- **Email notification** — enter your email to receive a download link when a long generation completes, so you can close the browser
