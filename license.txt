GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 19 November 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains
free software for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have
the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them
if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs,
and that you know you can do these things.

Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you
this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
modify it.

A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that improvements
made in alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread use,
become available for other developers to incorporate. Many developers
of free software are heartened and encouraged by the resulting cooperation.

However, in the case of software used on network servers, this result
may fail to come about. The GNU General Public License permits making
a modified version and letting the public access it on a server without
ever releasing its source code to the public.

The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure
that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available to the
community. It requires the operator of a network server to provide the
source code of the modified version running there to the users of that
server.

An older license, called the Affero General Public License and published
by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals. This is a different
license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has released a new
version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under this license.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.
